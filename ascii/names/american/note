NOTE:
There's a lot of prejudice encoded in these category groupings.

The idea of these groupings is that there's a "typical" group
and then a variety of namelists broken up by negative connotation.

In the distant future, NPCs who have attained wealth and success are
likely to be generated with names from the non-negatively connotated
list. (To reflect name-related prejudice and match the player's
expectations of name-related prejudice.)

Unfortunately, that prejudice is based on racism and sexism. So, for
now, here are the negative connotations and what they mean:

feminine_first.ascii:
  "Normal" feminine names.

feminine_first_enby.ascii:
  Female names that aren't sufficiently gendered.

feminine_first_fun.ascii:
  Female names that connote playfulness or sexual looseness.
  Often diminutive. (like "Nicky")

feminine_first_classweird.ascii:
  Female names that connote nonwhiteness or lower-class economic
  background. Often invented names.

feminine_first_literary.ascii:
  Female names that are long or literary.
  This connotes wealthy background but can be alienating.
  Plutocrats are unlikely to have this kind of name.

feminine_first_nobject.ascii:
  Uncommon, not-especially-literary names with high connotations
  of professionalism/competence.

masculine_first.ascii:
  "Normal" masculine names.

masculine_first_enby.ascii:
  Masculine names that aren't sufficiently gendered.

masculine_first_literary.ascii:
  Masculine names that are long or literary.
  This connotes wealthy background but can be alienating.
  Plutocrats are unlikely to have this kind of name.

masculine_first_nonwhite.ascii:
  Masculine names that are stereotypically nonwhite.
